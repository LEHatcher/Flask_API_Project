Welcome to my Flask API project

I'm really exciting to get into the world of APIs and Flask.  To start with I build this in VS Code using mostly
Python that included OOP and featured decorators.  
My libraries included Flash and SQLAlchemy.

I used the Thunder Client app in VS code to perform CRUD operations to manipulate my data that I had entered in a JSON format.  
My data consisted of names and emails.
